/**
 * \class EEPROM24 EEPROM24.h <EEPROM24.h>
 * \brief Reading and writing EEPROM's from the 24LCXX family.
 *
 * The 24LCXX family of EEPROM's provide a variety of memory sizes from
 * 16 bytes up to 128 kBytes that can be accessed via the I2C protocol.
 * These chips can be used to augment the 1 kByte or so of builtin EEPROM
 * memory that is typical on Arduino boards.  The EEPROM should be wired
 * to an Arduino Uno as follows:
 *
 * \image html eeprom_circuit.png
 *
 * Access to a 24LCXX chip is initialized as follows:
 *
 * \code
 * SoftI2C i2c(A4, A5);
 * EEPROM24 eeprom(i2c, EEPROM_24LC256);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Once initialized, read() and write() can be used to manipulate the
 * contents of the EEPROM's memory.
 *
 * The following EEPROM types are supported by this class:
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr><td>Chip</td><td>Type</td><td>Size</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc00</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC00</td><td>16 bytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc01</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC01</td><td>128 bytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc014</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC014</td><td>128 bytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc02</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC02</td><td>256 bytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc024</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC024</td><td>256 bytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc025</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC025</td><td>256 bytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc04</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC04</td><td>512 bytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc08</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC08</td><td>1 kByte</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc16</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC16</td><td>2 kBytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc32</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC32</td><td>4 kBytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc64</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC64</td><td>8 kBytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc128</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC128</td><td>16 kBytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc256</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC256</td><td>32 kBytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc512</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC512</td><td>64 kBytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc1025</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC1025</td><td>128 kBytes</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>24lc1026</td><td>\c EEPROM_24LC1026</td><td>128 kBytes</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * There can be multiple 24LCXX chips on the same I2C bus, as long as their
 * A0, A1, and A2 address pins are set to different values.  For example,
 * two 24LC256 chips can be used to provide the same memory capacity as a
 * single 24LC512 chip.  The optional <i>bank</i> parameter to the constructor
 * is used to assign different bank addresses to each chip:
 *
 * \code
 * SoftI2C i2c(A4, A5);
 * EEPROM24 eeprom0(i2c, EEPROM_24LC256, 0);
 * EEPROM24 eeprom1(i2c, EEPROM_24LC256, 1);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \sa I2CMaster
