*   Pattern Decoder Library V3
*   Library to decode radio signals based on patternd detection

*   This library contains classes to perform decoding of digital signals
*   typical for home automation. The focus for the moment is on different sensors
*   like weather sensors (temperature, humidity Logilink, TCM, Oregon Scientific, ...),
*   remote controlled power switches (Intertechno, TCM, ARCtech, ...) which use
*   encoder chips like PT2262 and EV1527-type and manchester encoder to send
*   information in the 433MHz or 868 Mhz Band.
*
*   The classes in this library follow the approach to detect a recurring pattern in the
*   recived signal. For Manchester there is a class which decodes the signal.
