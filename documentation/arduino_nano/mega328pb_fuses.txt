default fuses (AtMega328pb) - stock

avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e9516 (probably m328pb)
avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as 62
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as D9
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as F7
avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:F7, H:D9, L:62)


custom fuses:
CFD = CFD_ENABLED
BODLEVEL = 2V7
RSTDISBL = [ ]
DWEN = [ ]
SPIEN = [X]
WDTON = [ ]
EESAVE = [X]
BOOTSZ = 1024W_3C00
BOOTRST = [ ]
CKDIV8 = [ ]
CKOUT = [ ]
SUT_CKSEL = EXTXOSC_8MHZ_XX_16KCK_14CK_65MS

EXTENDED = 0xFD (valid)
HIGH = 0xD3 (valid)
LOW = 0xFF (valid)


##Quick command reference

AVRDUDE arguments,
to set fuses...

(same as m328p)

  -->> this is used on https://loetmeister.de/Elektronik/homematic/index.htm#modules <<--
  To disable bootloader & preserve EEPROM memory:
  avrdude -c AVRISPmkII -p m328pb -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xd3:m -U efuse:w:0xfd:m

  --> efuse: 0xfd may not be accepted. User other tools, e.g. Atmel Studio
  

to flash...
  (no boot loader version):
  avrdude -c AVRISPmkII -p m328pb -U flash:w:HBW-device.ino.eightanaloginputs.hex:i -v
